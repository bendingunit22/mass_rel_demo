It's pretty janky and definitely took longer than an hour but I had fun making it!!

The thought of doing stuff like this for a whole summer is really exciting.

There are some comments sprinkled throughout the code but the jist of my example is this:

In the external /script.js/ I created a poller, and used the callback in conjunction with the map method to populate an array which gets converted to html. Each slice of the array is appended to the html section, displaying the random counts and associated band names. I'm sure there's a more elegant way to do this and I'd love to find out how you guys actually do this.

There is a jquery .effect method that flashes every time the counts are updated.
